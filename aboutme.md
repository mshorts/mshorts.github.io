Hi, I'm Matt Shorts. Officially Matthew, but that's usually only when I'm in trouble or being formal. I'm a technologist at heart, always trying to play with new technology and learning new things. My latest adventure is with [Cox 2M](https://www.cox2m.com), the commercial IoT offering from Cox Communications, as Head of Product, Technology, & Innovation. While my site is not officially affiliated with Cox 2M, there will be lots of parallels because I really like what I do!

When I’m not playing with tech, I can be found with my awesome family or following Notre Dame sports. Thanks for stopping by and checking me out. I post articles from time to time on neat new things I’m exploring, but by no means will it be regular (yet). Feel free to reach out, I’m always excited to meet people, talk ND football, or explore new things.
